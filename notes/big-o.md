# Big O

A notation to measure the asymptotic complexity of algorithms agnostic of hardware and software. In layman's terms how fast a function runs as inputs increases

Notation doesn't need to be 1:1 i.e we just say O(1) instead of O(1)

## Linear = O(n)

## Constant = O(1)

## Logarithmic = O(log n)
Binary search

Upper (O) and lower (Ω omega) bounds can be defined

## Linear = O(n)

Binary search

Upper (O) and lower (Ω omega) bounds can be defined

Binary search Ω(1) and O(log n)

Linear search Ω(1) and O(n)

Theta (ϴ) denotes equivalent upper and lower bounds

Only the greatest complexity is counted for the complexity i.e if there is O(1) O(n) and O(n^2) only O(n^2) is counted

## Space complexity

There's also the concept of space complexity or how much memory usage increases instead of time to run
